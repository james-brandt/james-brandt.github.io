      <span>I'm James Brandt, a designer based in Minneapolis, MN.<br>
        I am interested in all aspects of the design process. <br>
        Especially when the design is innovative, understandable, and useful.</span></h1>

      <h1>&#127912 About me:</h1>
      <p>I am a design student currently living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Presently I am attending the University of Minnesota, where I am working on a degree that combines User Experience Design, Psychology, and Digital Design. <br> <br>
        My skill set involves user research, graphic communication, and web design. My most recent career experiences have involved designing projects that utilize user research to improve interface design.
        <br> <br>
        As a designer, I consider myself open-minded, optimistic, and eager to learn. I'm always browsing the web to learn new design techniques or new technologies. And outside of designing, I enjoy running, drinking (too much) coffee, and listening to electronic music.
        <br> <br> <i><u>Interested in working together or grabbing a cup of coffee? </u> </i> <br> <a href = "mailto: BRAN1400@UMN.EDU"> Email</a> me and view my <a href="/Resume.pdf">resume</a>!</p>
